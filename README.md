Three observations that I can gather from this data is,
1) The drug regimen's of Capomulin and Ramicare had the most tumor volume within the studies.
2) There were a nearly equal number of male and female study units, which means that the sex seemed to have no effect on tumor volume.
3) The more time the study units had with the drug regimen, the smaller the tumor size got. Which can be concluded that the drug regimen
is not success with short term results but had success with long term ones.
